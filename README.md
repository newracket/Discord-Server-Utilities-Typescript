# Discord-Server-Utilities-Bot

Discord bot written in typescript with various commands for managing a discord. The process of managing a discord can be tedious, with the person having to click many things in order to do a simple task, and this bot aims to make the entire process quicker and less tedious.

This is a typescript rewrite of my old bot at (https://github.com/newracket/Discord-Server-Utilities). There are several commands which still need to be added, and will be added soon. 

## Role Management Commands:
- Createrole/Deleterole (creates or deletes a role)
- Grantrole/Removerole (grants or removes a role from a member)
- Modifyrole (modifies a role name or color)
- Displayabove (displays a role above another role)

## Other Moderation Commands:
- Archive/Unarchive (archives or unarchives a channel - moves it to a separate archives category)
- Mute/Unmute (mutes or unmutes a member)
- Changenick (changes a member's nickname)

## Miscellaneous Commands:
- Define (defines a word)
- Math (executes a math expression)
- Random (chooses a random choice among several choices)
- Roleinfo (displays information about a specific role)
- Rolemembers (displays all members with a specific role)
- Roles (displays all roles in the server)
- Tts (speaks text in the voice channel the person is in)
